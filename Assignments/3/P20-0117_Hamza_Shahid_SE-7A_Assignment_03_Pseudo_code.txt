Initialize:
- Choose two large prime numbers p and q, such that (p % 4 == 3) and (q % 4 == 3).
- Compute N = p * q.
- Choose a random seed value X0, where (X0 < N) and relatively prime to N.

Generate Pseudorandom Bits:
For each pseudorandom bit you want to generate:
	- Compute X_{i+1} = (X_i * X_i) % N.
	- Extract the least significant bit (LSB) of X_{i+1} as the pseudorandom bit.

Repeat the above step for as many bits as needed.

Output the generated pseudorandom bits.
